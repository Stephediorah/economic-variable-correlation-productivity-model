# economic-variable-correlation-productivity-model

The primary focus of this report is to investigate how changes in money supply influence currency depreciation, stock market appreciation, and inflation, ultimately impacting productivity. Given the scenario of a flat money supply, the analysis seeks to isolate the effects of other economic factors on productivity changes.

METHODOLOGY
This section outlines the systematic approach taken to analyze the relationships among money supply, exchange rates, inflation, and productivity. The methodology involves several key steps, including data collection, model formulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

DATA COLLECTION

The data utilized in this analysis was extracted from different financial and economic data sources to gather the data containing detailed information on money supply (M1), exchange rates, inflation rates, and stock market prices from 2004 till 2024. The dataset was carefully reviewed for accuracy and completeness to ensure reliable analysis.

CURRENCY DEVALUATION
 
Currency devaluation is a critical metric that reflects the loss of a currency's value relative to other currencies, impacting trade balances, inflation, and overall economic stability.

As at July 2020; USD/NGN was 380.7 NGN
As at July 2024; USD/NGN was 1,590.301 NGN 

Devaluation = 1,590.301 -380.7 = 1209.601/ 380.7 = 3.2

Therefore Currency devaluation = 320%

This means NGN has depreciated by 320% in the past 4 years.
